Mobile-style DateTimePicker
===========================

A jQuery plugin, aids date and time selection. 

Interface is similar to the one on mobile devices - date and time can be udjusted
using 'up' (+) and 'down'(-) buttons. Date popup is compact, which is very convenient,
when a user is expected to adjust date only slightly
and doesn't really need to see a whole calendar.
